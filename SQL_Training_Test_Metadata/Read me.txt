***
Metadata_roi_only.csv is a fused table of metadata.csv and 
all the test and training data. This means it contains columns like 
pathology(classification) while having the folder paths of each ROI folder.

Goal is to use this table to aid in script searching all the ROI dcm files 
and perhaps simipify code.

***
Scripts folder is how to create each csv. 
In this order:
Run the test and training data.sql,
Run the Metadata.sql
Run the Metadata_Edited.sql
Run the Metadata_roi.sql
 
***
Misc. Details

Metadata_edited.csv is the filtered metadata.csv up that only contains ROI entries
but isn't a fused table(so no classification details)
